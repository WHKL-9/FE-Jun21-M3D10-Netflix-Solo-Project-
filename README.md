# FE-Jun21-M3D10-Netflix-Solo-Project-

Hey people, 7 weeks into Strive School's Frontend program, I was  challeneged to develop a netflix clone with some basic functionalities: 

// Create a backoffice page for inserting, editing and removing movies
//  Every movie will have a category
// On the main page you should create, programmatically, a number of “lists” equal to the number of categories you have created

Technologies used in this project: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS

Navigation through the Project: 
- Back Office
  -- a page for you to enter your movies details (name, description, category and image URL) 
  -- successfully uploaded movie will be added to the homepage
  
- Homepage
  -- a page where all your movies is shown by catogories
  -- if you click on any of the movie cards, you can go into the "edit page" for that particular movie to edit the info or delete the entire movie from backoffice
  
  P/S: I have also added some loading indicator on the homepage to let user know their movies are being fetched 

Up until this point, I have completed 50% of my journey on Strive School. Is it hard? Yes. Is it fulfilling? Most definitely! Before that, I see programmer as the one 
performing all the cool magics. Now, I are learning more magic spells each day to perform more computational "magic" each day. Loving every sinlge bit of this journey!
